# Plugin API

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout>
  The plugin API is highly experimental and is likely to experience breaking
  changes.
</Callout>

The [plugin API](/docs/api-reference/plugins) enables developers to share extensions to Puck, and are generally built on top of existing APIs.

## Official plugins

Puck provides official plugins for common use-cases:

- [`emotion-cache`](https://github.com/measuredco/puck/tree/main/packages/plugin-emotion-cache): Inject emotion cache into the Puck iframe.
- [`heading-analyzer`](https://github.com/measuredco/puck/tree/main/packages/plugin-heading-analyzer): Analyze the heading outline of your page and be warned when you're not respecting WCAG 2 accessibility standards.

Please see the [awesome-puck repo](https://github.com/measuredco/awesome-puck) for a full list of community plugins.

## Loading a Plugin

To load a plugin, provide it to the [`plugins` prop](/docs/api-reference/components/puck#plugins) on the `<Puck>` component.

```tsx showLineNumbers {2,8}
import { Puck } from "@measured/puck";
import myPlugin from "my-puck-plugin";

export function Editor() {
  return (
    <Puck
      // ...
      plugins={[myPlugin]}
    />
  );
}
```

## Developing a Plugin

If you're familiar with Puck, you can likely already build a Puck plugin. See the [Plugin API reference](/docs/api-reference/plugins) for a full breakdown of available APIs.

### Transforming fields

Plugins support [Field Transforms](/docs/extending-puck/field-transforms), enabling you to modify prop data before it's rendered in the `<Puck>` preview.

```tsx showLineNumbers copy
const plugin = {
  fieldTransforms: {
    // Make all props powered by "text" field pink in the editor
    text: ({ value }) => <span style={{ color: "hotpink" }}>{value}</span>,
  },
};
```

### Overriding the UI

Plugins support [UI Overrides](/docs/extending-puck/ui-overrides), enabling you to override discrete section of the Puck interface.

```tsx showLineNumbers copy
const plugin = {
  overrides: {
    // Make all drawer items pink
    drawerItem: ({ name }) => <div style={{ color: "hotpink" }}>{name}</div>,
  },
};
```

<Callout type="info">

<b>Override currying</b>

Plugin overrides are rendered in the order they are defined. Unless otherwise specified, all overrides are _curried_, meaning that the return node of one plugin will be passed as `children` to the next plugin.

This may result in some incompatible plugin combinations. To improve your chance of building a widely compatible plugin, consider:

1. Implementing as few override methods as you need
2. Always rendering `children` if possible
