# Fonts

Puck uses the [Inter typeface family](https://rsms.me/inter/) by default, loaded via a CDN.

It's possible to change the font, or provide your own version of Inter if you need to host it locally.

## Load your own font file

To load your own font file, use the `no-external.css` bundle instead of the primary one.

```css
/* @import "@measured/puck/puck.css"; */
@import "@measured/puck/no-external.css";
```

## Changing the font family

To change the font family Puck uses, change the [`--puck-font-family`](/docs/api-reference/theming#--puck-font-family) CSS property:

```css
/* @import "@measured/puck/puck.css"; */
@import "@measured/puck/no-external.css";

:root {
  --puck-font-family: Arial;
}
```
